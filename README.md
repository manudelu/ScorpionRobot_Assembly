Mechanical Design Methods in Robotics 
======================================
Design of Clementoni's Scorpion Robot using Creo Parametric 3D Modeling Software Ver. 8.0
==========================================================================================

Project Description
----------------------
At the beginning of the course, several pieces of a toy scorpion robot were assigned to each team. [Link to the Assembly Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFq4Ctjfaao)

Then, each team must:
- `Step1`: Take measurements of their parts, by means of a caliper, and make technical drawings. These will later be needed in order to model the parts on [Creo Parametric 8.0](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/creo/parametric). 
- `Step2`: Start the design of each assigned part.
- `Step3`: Begin assembling the robot: Each team will need to make their parts available so that the other teams can work individually on assembling the scorpion robot. Communication between teams is needed so that any measurement or design errors made in the previous steps can be adjusted.

`Note:` If you need guidance on assembling the product, there is also a manual available. The manual provides step-by-step instructions and detailed information on how to correctly assemble the product.
